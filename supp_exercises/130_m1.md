### 1. Listening Device

Below we have a listening device. It lets us record something that is said and store it for later use. In general, this is how the device should be used:

Listen for something, and if anything is said, record it for later use. If nothing is said, then do not record anything.

```ruby
class Device
  def initialize
    @recordings = []
  end

  def record(recording)
    @recordings << recording
  end
end
```

Anything that is said is retrieved by this listening device via a block. If nothing is said, then no block will be passed in. The listening device can also output what was recently recorded using a Device#play method.

```ruby
listener = Device.new
listener.listen { "Hello World!" }
listener.listen
listener.play # Outputs "Hello World!"
```

Finish the above program so that the specifications listed above are met.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Device
  def initialize
    @recordings = []
  end

  def record(recording)
    @recordings << recording
  end

  def listen
    record(yield) if block_given?
  end

  def play
    p "#{@recordings.last}"
  end
end
```

### 2. Text Analyzer - Sandwich Code

Fill out the rest of the Ruby code below so that output similar to "Sample Output" is sent to the terminal. To get such output, read some text from a file in process and pass that text to the block provided to each call. Note, that the everything you need to work on is either part of the process method or part of one of the 3 blocks. No other additions or changes are required. The text you use does not have to produce the same numbers as the sample output, but should have the indicated format.

```ruby
class TextAnalyzer
  def process
    # your implementation
  end
end

analyzer = TextAnalyzer.new
analyzer.process { |file| puts # your implementation }
analyzer.process { |file| puts # your  implementation }
analyzer.process { |file| puts # your implementation }

# Sample Output:

3 paragraphs
25 lines
306 words
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class TextAnalyzer
  def process
    File.open('sample.txt', 'r') do |file|
      yield(file.read)
      file.close
    end
  end
end

analyzer = TextAnalyzer.new
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split("\n\n").count}  paragraph(s)" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split(".\n").count} line(s)" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split.count} word(s)" }
```

### 3. Passing Parameters, Part 1

Modify the method below so that the display/output of items is moved to a block, and its implementation is left up to the user of the gather method.

```ruby
items = ['apples', 'corn', 'cabbage', 'wheat']

def gather(items)
  puts "Let's start gathering food."
  puts "#{items.join(', ')}"
  puts "Let's start gathering food."
end
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
items = ['apples', 'corn', 'cabbage', 'wheat']

def gather(items)
  puts "Let's start gathering food."
  yield(items)
  puts "Let's start gathering food."
end

gather(items) { puts "#{items.join(', ')}" }
```

### 4. Passing Parameters, Part 2

But, what if we wanted to organize our array contents into categories, where variables represent category names. Could we do that without directly grabbing certain items from particular array indices?

There is one way to do it, and that is by using the splat operator `*`. We can do something like this

```ruby
raven, finch, *birds_of_prey = %w(raven finch hawk eagle)
p raven # => 'raven'
p finch # => 'finch'
p birds_of_prey # => ['hawk','eagle']
```

Based on the information given above, write a method that takes an array as an argument. In that method, yield the contents of the array to a block. In the block, write your block variables in such a way that the first two items are discarded, and the last time items are treated as birds of prey.

#### Solution:

```ruby
def do_something_with_names(array)
  yield(array)
end

flying_things = [ 'airplanes', 'flies', 'hawks', 'eagles', 'falcons' ]

do_something_with_names(flying_things) { |item1, item2, *raptors | puts "#{raptors}" }
```


### 5. Passing Parameters, Part 3

Given this code:

```ruby
items = ['apples', 'corn', 'cabbage', 'wheat']

def gather(items)
  puts "Let's start gathering food."
  yield(items)
  puts "We've finished gathering!"
end
```

Fill out the following method calls for gather so that they produce the corresponding output shown in numbers 1-4 listed below:

```ruby
# 1

gather(items) do | , |
  puts
  puts
end

Let's start gathering food.
apples, corn, cabbage
wheat
We've finished gathering!

# 2

gather(items) do | , , |
  puts
  puts
  puts
end
Let's start gathering food.
apples
corn, cabbage
wheat
We've finished gathering!

```

#### Solutions:

```ruby
items = ['apples', 'corn', 'cabbage', 'wheat']

def gather(items)
  puts "Let's start gathering food."
  yield(items)
  puts "We've finished gathering!"
end

# 1
gather(items) do | *gluten_free, glutenous|
  puts gluten_free.join(', ')
  puts glutenous
end

# 2
gather(items) do | fruit, *veggies, gluten |
  puts fruit
  puts veggies.join(', ')
  puts gluten
end

# 3
gather(items) do | fruit, *other_stuff |
  puts fruit
  puts other_stuff.join(', ')
end

# 4
gather(items) do | item1, item2, item3, item4 |
  puts "#{item1}, #{item2}, #{item3}, and #{item4}"
end
```

### 6. Exploring Procs, Lambdas, and Blocks: Definitions and Arity

```ruby
# Group 1
my_proc = proc { |thing| puts "This is a #{thing}." }
puts my_proc
puts my_proc.class
my_proc.call
my_proc.call('cat')

# Group 2
my_lambda = lambda { |thing| puts "This is a #{thing}" }
my_second_lambda = -> (thing) { puts "This is a #{thing}" }
puts my_lambda
puts my_second_lambda
puts my_lambda.class
my_lambda.call('dog')
my_lambda.call
my_third_lambda = Lambda.new { |thing| puts "This is a #{thing}" }

# Group 3
def block_method_1(animal)
  yield
end

block_method_1('seal') { |seal| puts "This is a #{seal}."}
block_method_1('seal')

# Group 4
def block_method_2(animal)
  yield(animal)
end

block_method_2('turtle') { |turtle| puts "This is a #{turtle}."}
block_method_2('turtle') do |turtle, seal|
  puts "This is a #{turtle} and a #{seal}."
end
block_method_2('turtle') { puts "This is a #{animal}."}
```

### Solution:

```ruby 
# Group 1
my_proc = proc { |thing| puts "This is a #{thing}." }
puts my_proc # #<Proc:0x007fde3b90b2a0@scrap.rb:2>
puts my_proc.class # Proc
my_proc.call # This is a .
my_proc.call('cat') # This is a cat.

# 1) Observations: The proc's id includes reference to the file and line, apparently stored as an instance variable; is this part of storing its binding?  Passing in a argument is optional; i.e. not passing in an argument does not raise exception.

# Group 2
my_lambda = lambda { |thing| puts "This is a #{thing}" }
my_second_lambda = -> (thing) { puts "This is a #{thing}" }
puts my_lambda # #<Proc:0x007f8eec05a8e8@scrap.rb:11 (lambda)>
puts my_second_lambda #  #<Proc:0x007f8eec05a898@scrap.rb:12 (lambda)>
puts my_lambda.class # Proc
my_lambda.call('dog') # This is a dog.
my_lambda.call # wrong number of arguments error
my_third_lambda = Lambda.new { |thing| puts "This is a #{thing}" }

# 2) Observations: The most obvious difference is that the lambda does raise an exception if an argument is not passed in.

# # Group 3
def block_method_1(animal)
  yield
end

block_method_1('seal') { |seal| puts "This is a #{seal}."} # This is a .
block_method_1('seal') # no block given...LocalJumpError

# 3) Observations: blocks 


# Group 4
def block_method_2(animal)
  yield(animal)
end

block_method_2('turtle') { |turtle| puts "This is a #{turtle}."} # This is a turtle.
block_method_2('turtle') do |turtle, seal|
  puts "This is a #{turtle} and a #{seal}."
end # This is a turtle and a .
block_method_2('turtle') { puts "This is a #{animal}."} # undefined local variable or method `animal`
```
> Comparison

Lambdas are types of Proc's. Technically they are both Proc objects. An implicit block is a grouping of code, a type of closure, it is not an Object.
Lambdas enforce the number of arguments passed to them. Implicit block and Procs do not enforce the number of arguments passed in.

### 7. Exploring Procs, Lambdas, and Blocks: Returning

For this exercise, we'll be learning and practicing our knowledge of returning from lambdas, procs, and implicit blocks.
Run each group of code below: For your answer to this exercise, write down your observations for each group of code. After writing out those observations, write one final analysis that explains the differences between procs, blocks, and lambdas.

```ruby
# Group 1
def check_return_with_proc
  my_proc = proc { return }
  my_proc.call
  puts "This will never output to screen."
end

check_return_with_proc

# Group 2
my_proc = proc { return }

def check_return_with_proc_2(my_proc)
  my_proc.call
end

check_return_with_proc_2(my_proc)

# Group 3
def check_return_with_lambda
  my_lambda = lambda { return }
  my_lambda.call
  puts "This will be output to screen."
end

check_return_with_lambda

# Group 4
my_lambda = lambda { return }
def check_return_with_lambda(my_lambda)
  my_lambda.call
  puts "This will be output to screen."
end

check_return_with_lambda(my_lambda)

# Group 5
def block_method_3
  yield
end

block_method_3 { return }
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
# Group 1
def check_return_with_proc
  my_proc = proc { return }
  my_proc.call
  puts "This will never output to screen."
end

check_return_with_proc  # [nothing outputs to screen]
                        # => nil
                        
# Group 2
my_proc = proc { return }

def check_return_with_proc_2(my_proc)
  my_proc.call
end

check_return_with_proc_2(my_proc) # unexpected return (LocalJumpError)

# Group 3
def check_return_with_lambda
  my_lambda = lambda { return }
  my_lambda.call
  puts "This will be output to screen." 
end

check_return_with_lambda #  This will be output to screen.
                         # => nil

 # Group 4
 my_lambda = lambda { return }
 def check_return_with_lambda(my_lambda)
   my_lambda.call
   puts "This will be output to screen."
 end

 check_return_with_lambda(my_lambda) # This will be output to screen.
                                     # => nil
 
 # Group 5
 def block_method_3
   yield
 end

 block_method_3 { return } # unexpected return (LocalJumpError)
```
