### 1. From-To-Step Sequence Generator

The Range#step method lets you iterate over a range of values where each value in the iteration is the previous value plus a "step" value. It returns the original range.

Write a method that does the same thing as Range#step, but does not operate on a range. Instead, your method should take 3 arguments: the starting value, the ending value, and the step value to be applied to each iteration. Your method should also take a block to which it will yield (or call) successive iteration values.

Example:
```ruby
step(1, 10, 3) { |value| puts "value = #{value}" }
value = 1
value = 4
value = 7
value = 10
```

What do you think would be a good return value for this method, and why?

#### Solution:
To model off of the Range#step method, returning the range that the method stepped through would make sense.
```ruby
def step(start, stop, step)
  current_value = start
  
  while current_value <= stop
    yield(current_value)
    current_value += step
  end
  (start..stop)
end

step(1, 10, 3) { |value| puts "value = #{value}" }
value = 1
value = 4
value = 7
value = 10
```

### 2. Zipper

The Array#zip method takes two arrays, and combines them into a single array in which each element is a two-element array where the first element is a value from one array, and the second element is a value from the second array, in order. For example:
```ruby
[1, 2, 3].zip([4, 5, 6]) == [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
```
Write your own version of zip that does the same type of operation. It should take two Arrays as arguments, and return a new Array (the original Arrays should not be changed). Do not use the built-in Array#zip method. You may assume that both input arrays have the same number of elements.

Example:
```ruby
zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) == [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
```

#### Solution:
```ruby
def zip(array1, array2)
  zipped = []
  index = 0

  while index < array1.length
    zipped.push([array1[index], array2[index]])
    index += 1
  end

  zipped
end

p zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])  == [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
```

### 3. map

The Enumerable#map method iterates over the members of a collection, using the associated block to perform some sort of operation on each collection member. The returned values from the block are then built up into an Array that is then returned to the caller. Note in particular that every time #map yields to the block, it obtains just one value. That value may be a complex value - it may even be another collection - but it is nevertheless just one value. Thus, #map returns an Array that has the same number of elements that the original collection had.

Write a method called map that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return a new Array that contains the return values produced by the block for each element of the original Array.

If the Array is empty, map should return an empty Array, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
map([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value**2 } == [1, 9, 36]
map([]) { |value| true } == []
map(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) { |value| false } == [false, false, false, false]
map(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) { |value| value.upcase } == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
map([1, 3, 4]) { |value| (1..value).to_a } == [[1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
```

#### Solution:
```ruby
def map(array)
  mapped = []
  array.each do |element|
    mapped.push(yield(element))
  end
  mapped
end

p map([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value**2 } == [1, 9, 36]
p map([]) { |value| true } == []
p map(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) { |value| false } == [false, false, false, false]
p map(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) { |value| value.upcase } == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
p map([1, 3, 4]) { |value| (1..value).to_a } == [[1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
p map({a: 1, b: 2}) { |pair| true }
p map({a: 1, b: 2}) { |_, v| v + 2 }
```

#### Further Exploration:

Does your solution work with other collections like Hashes or Sets?

#### Solution:
As long as the block variables employ hash syntax, my method will work on hashes.

### 4. count

The Enumerable#count method iterates over the members of a collection, passing each element to the associated block. It then returns the number of elements for which the block returns a truthy value.

Write a method called count that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return the total number of elements for which the block returns true.

If the Array is empty, count should return 0.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value.odd? } == 2
count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == 1
count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value > 6 } == 0
count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| true } == 3
count([]) { |value| true } == 0
count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value - 6 } == 3
```

```ruby

def count(array)
  sum = 0
  array.each do |element|
    sum += 1 if yield(element)
  end
  sum
end

puts count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value.odd? } == 2
puts count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == 1
puts count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value > 6 } == 0
puts count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| true } == 3
puts count([]) { |value| true } == 0
puts count([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value - 6 } == 3
```

#### Further Exploration

Why does our final example return 3?

#### Solution:

The final example returns 3 because `value - 6` is truthy; it is neither `nil` nor `false`, so it returns `true`. For example:
```ruby
2.3.1 :031 > !!(v - 6)
 => true
```

### 5. drop_while

The Enumerable#drop_while method begins by iterating over the members of a collection, passing each element to the associated block until it finds an element for which the block returns false or nil. It then converts the remainder of the collection (including the element that resulted in a falsey return) to an Array, and returns the result.

Write a method called drop_while that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return all of the elements of the Array, except those elements at the beginning of the Array that produce a truthy value when passed to the block.

If the Array is empty, or if the block returns a truthy value for every element, drop_while should return an empty Array.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.odd? } == [6]
drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == [1, 3, 5, 6]
drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| true } == []
drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| false } == [1, 3, 5, 6]
drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value < 5 } == [5, 6]
drop_while([]) { |value| true } == []
```

```ruby
def drop_while(array)
  start = nil
  array.each_with_index do |element, index|
    start = index unless yield(element)
    break if start
  end

  start ? array[start..-1] : []
end

p drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.odd? } == [6]
p drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == [1, 3, 5, 6]
p drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| true } == []
p drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| false } == [1, 3, 5, 6]
p drop_while([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value < 5 } == [5, 6]
p drop_while([]) { |value| true } == []
```

### 6. each_with_index

The Enumerable#each_with_index method iterates over the members of a collection, passing each element and its index to the associated block. The value returned by the block is not used. each_with_index returns a reference to the original collection.

Write a method called each_with_index that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should yield each element and an index number to the block. each_with_index should return a reference to the original Array.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
result = each_with_index([1, 3, 6]) do |value, index|
  puts "#{index} -> #{value**index}"
end

puts result == [1, 3, 6]
```
should output:
```ruby
0 -> 1
1 -> 3
2 -> 36
true
```
#### Solution:

```ruby
def each_with_index(array)
  index = 0

  while index < array.length
    yield(array[index], index)
    index += 1
  end

  array
end

result = each_with_index([1, 3, 6]) do |value, index|
  puts "#{index} -> #{value**index}"
end

puts result == [1, 3, 6]
```

### 7. each_with_object

The Enumerable#each_with_object method iterates over the members of a collection, passing each element and an arbitrary object (usually a collection) to the associated block. The value returned by the block is not used. The object that is passed to the block is defined as an argument to each_with_obect; with each iteration, this object may be updated by the block. When iteration is complete, the final value of the object is returned.

Write a method called each_with_object that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array and an object of some sort as an argument, and a block. It should yield each element and the object to the block. each_with_object should return the final value of the object.

If the Array is empty, each_with_object should return the original object passed as its second argument.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_index, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
result = each_with_object([1, 3, 5], []) do |value, list|
  list << value**2
end
result == [1, 9, 25]

result = each_with_object([1, 3, 5], []) do |value, list|
  list << (1..value).to_a
end
result == [[1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]

result = each_with_object([1, 3, 5], {}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value] = value**2
end
result == { 1 => 1, 3 => 9, 5 => 25 }

result = each_with_object([], {}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value] = value * 2
end
result == {}
```

#### Solution:
```ruby
def each_with_object(array, object)
  array.each do |element|
    yield(element, object)
  end

  object
end
```

### 8. max_by

The Enumberable#max_by method iterates over the members of a collection, passing each element to the associated block. It then returns the element for which the block returned the largest value.

Write a method called max_by that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array and a block, and return the element that contains the largest value.

If the Array is empty, max_by should return nil.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
max_by([1, 5, 3]) { |value| value + 2 } == 5
max_by([1, 5, 3]) { |value| 9 - value } == 1
max_by([1, 5, 3]) { |value| (96 - value).chr } == 1
max_by([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]]) { |value| value.size } == [3, 4, 5]
max_by([-7]) { |value| value * 3 } == -7
max_by([]) { |value| value + 5 } == nil
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
def max_by(array)
  return nil if array.empty?
  
  max = yield(array.first)
  max_element = array.first
  
  array.each do |element|
    new_value = yield(element)
    if new_value > max
      max = new_value
      max_element = element
    end
  end

  max_element
end
```

### 9. each_cons (Part 1)

The Enumberable#each_cons method iterates over the members of a collection taking each sequence of n consecutive elements at a time and passing them to the associated block for processing. It then returns a value of nil.

Write a method called each_cons that behaves similarly for Arrays, taking the elements 2 at a time. The method should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should yield each consecutive pair of elements to the block, and return nil.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
hash = {}
result = each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end

result == nil
hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
each_cons([]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
hash == {}

hash = {}
each_cons(['a', 'b']) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
hash == {'a' => 'b'}
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
def each_cons(array)
  index = 0
  
  while index + 1 < array.length
    yield(array[index], array[index + 1])
    index += 1
  end
end
```

### 10. each_cons (Part 2)

In the previous exercise, we wrote a method that emulates Enumerable#each_cons, but limited our method to handling 2 elements at a time. Enumerable#each_cons can actually handle any number of elements at a time: 1, 2, 3, or more.

Update your each_cons method so it takes an argument that specifies how many elements should be processed at a time.

Your method may use #each, #each_index, #each_with_object, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

Examples:
```ruby
hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 1) do |value|
  hash[value] = true
end
hash == { 1 => true, 3 => true, 6 => true, 10 => true }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 2) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 3) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values
end
hash == { 1 => [3, 6], 3 => [6, 10] }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 4) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values
end
hash == { 1 => [3, 6, 10] }

hash = {}
each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10], 5) do |value1, *values|
  hash[value1] = values
end
hash == {}
  ```
  
#### Solution:

```ruby
def each_cons(array, cons)
  index = 0
  until index + cons > array.length
    yield(*array[index, cons])
    index += 1
  end
end
```
