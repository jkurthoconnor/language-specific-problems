### 1. Cute angles

Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (˚) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute.

Examples:

```ruby
dms(30) == %(30°00'00")
dms(76.73) == %(76°43'48")
dms(254.6) == %(254°36'00")
dms(93.034773) == %(93°02'05")
dms(0) == %(0°00'00")
dms(360) == %(360°00'00") || dms(360) == %(0°00'00")
```
