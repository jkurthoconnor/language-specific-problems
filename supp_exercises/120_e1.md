### 1. Banner Class

Behold this incomplete class for constructing boxed banners.
```ruby
class Banner
  def initialize(message)
  end

  def to_s
    [horizontal_rule, empty_line, message_line, empty_line, horizontal_rule].join("\n")
  end

  private

  def horizontal_rule
  end

  def empty_line
  end

  def message_line
    "| #{@message} |"
  end
end
```

Complete this class so that the test cases shown below work as intended. You are free to add any methods or instance variables you need. However, do not make the implementation details public.

You may assume that the input will always fit in your terminal window.

Test Cases
```ruby
banner = Banner.new('To boldly go where no one has gone before.')
puts banner
+--------------------------------------------+
|                                            |
| To boldly go where no one has gone before. |
|                                            |
+--------------------------------------------+
banner = Banner.new('')
puts banner
+--+
|  |
|  |
|  |
+--+
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Banner
  def initialize(message)
    @message = message
    @length = message.length
  end

  def to_s
    [horizontal_rule, empty_line, message_line, empty_line, horizontal_rule].join("\n")
  end

  private

  def horizontal_rule
    left_corner = "+-"
    right_corner = "-+"
    "#{left_corner}#{make_line_middle('-')}#{right_corner}"
  end

  def empty_line
    blank_left_edge = '| '
    blank_right_edge = ' |'
    "#{blank_left_edge}#{make_line_middle(' ')}#{blank_right_edge}"
  end

  def make_line_middle(string, line_middle = '')
    @length.times { line_middle << string }
    line_middle
  end

  def message_line
    "| #{@message} |"
  end
end
```

#### Further Exploration
Modify this class so new will optionally let you specify a fixed banner width at the time the Banner object is created. The message in the banner should be centered within the banner of that width. Decide for yourself how you want to handle widths that are either too narrow or too wide.

#### Solution:
```ruby
class Banner
  def initialize(message, width = message.length)
    @message = message
    @width = width
    raise ArgumentError.new('Message is too long!') if @message.length > @width
  end

  def to_s
    [horizontal_rule, empty_line, message_line, empty_line, horizontal_rule].join("\n")
  end

  private

  def horizontal_rule
    left_corner = "+-"
    right_corner = "-+"
    "#{left_corner}#{make_line_middle('-')}#{right_corner}"
  end

  def empty_line
    blank_left_edge = '| '
    blank_right_edge = ' |'
    "#{blank_left_edge}#{make_line_middle(' ')}#{blank_right_edge}"
  end

  def make_line_middle(string, line_middle = '')
    @width.times { line_middle << string }
    line_middle
  end

  def message_line
    "| #{@message.center(@width, ' ')} |"
  end
end
```

### 2. What's the Output?

Take a look at the following code:
```ruby
class Pet
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name.to_s
  end

  def to_s
    @name.upcase!
    "My name is #{@name}."
  end
end

name = 'Fluffy'
fluffy = Pet.new(name)
puts fluffy.name
puts fluffy
puts fluffy.name
puts name
```
What output does this code print? Fix this class so that there are no surprises waiting in store for the unsuspecting developer.

#### Solution:

This code prints:
  Fluffy
  My name is FLUFFY.
  FLUFFY
  FLUFFY

The following code should print more expected results.  I revised under the assumption that the name should be output in all caps when `to_s` is called on the object, but that it should not be mutated.
```ruby
class Pet
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name.to_s
  end

  def to_s
    "My name is #{@name.upcase}."
  end
end
```

#### Further Exploration:

What would happen in this case?
```ruby
name = 42
fluffy = Pet.new(name)
name += 1
puts fluffy.name
puts fluffy
puts fluffy.name
puts name
```

This code "works" because of that mysterious to_s call in Pet#initialize. However, that doesn't explain why this code produces the result it does. Can you?

#### Solution:

The code prints to screen:
  42
  My name is 42.
  42
  43

This is because `name` in the first and last line is a local variable that points to an integer.  Line 3 increments the `name` object by 1.  This change does not affect the pet's name because the local variable `name` was passed into the Pet object at line 2.  At that point the value 42 is turned into a string and stored under `@name`.  When `name` is invoked in the final line this returns the object of the local variable `name`, not the instance variable `@name`.

### 3. Fix the Program - Books (Part 1)

Complete this program so that it produces the expected output:

```ruby
class Book
  def initialize(author, title)
    @author = author
    @title = title
  end

  def to_s
    %("#{title}", by #{author})
  end
end

book = Book.new("Neil Stephenson", "Snow Crash")
puts %(The author of "#{book.title}" is #{book.author}.)
puts %(book = #{book}.)
```
Expected output:

```ruby
The author of "Snow Crash" is Neil Stephenson.
book = "Snow Crash", by Neil Stephenson.
```

#### Solution:

The problem with the above code is that it lacks any reader methods.  Adding the following line will fix this:
```ruby
attr_reader :author, :title
```

#### Further Exploration

What are the differences between attr_reader, attr_writer, and attr_accessor? Why did we use attr_reader instead of one of the other two? Would it be okay to use one of the others? Why or why not?

Instead of attr_reader, suppose you had added the following methods to this class:

```ruby
def title
  @title
end

def author
  @author
end
```

Would this change the behavior of the class in any way? If so, how? If not, why not? Can you think of any advantages of this code?

#### Solution:

`attr_accessor` creates both reader and writer/setter methods for the named instance variables.  It would not work to use `attr_writer`, and using `attr_accessor` would work but it would also make public the ability to set an instance variable's value.  Depending on the intended use, this may not be desired.

Adding the code in the final example would not change the behavior.  It is simply a long-form way of creating reader methods for the named instance variables. 

### 4. Fix the Program - Books (Part 2)

Complete this program so that it produces the expected output:

```ruby
class Book
  def to_s
    %("#{title}", by #{author})
  end
end

book = Book.new
book.author = "Neil Stephenson"
book.title = "Snow Crash"
puts %(The author of "#{book.title}" is #{book.author}.)
puts %(book = #{book}.)
```
Expected output:

The author of "Snow Crash" is Neil Stephenson.
book = "Snow Crash", by Neil Stephenson.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Book
  attr_accessor :author, :title

  def to_s
    %("#{title}", by #{author})
  end
end

book = Book.new
book.author = "Neil Stephenson"
book.title = "Snow Crash"
puts %(The author of "#{book.title}" is #{book.author}.)
puts %(book = #{book}.)
```

#### Further Exploration

What do you think of this way of creating and initializing Book objects? (The two steps are separate.) Would it be better to create and initialize at the same time like in the previous exercise? What potential problems, if any, are introduced by separating the steps?

#### Solution:
In most use cases I can imagine, it makes more sense to initialize with object creation.  The most obvious danger of separating the two steps is that one may forget to assign a necessary instance variable.  When initialization and object instantiation occur at the same time the user will see an error if not all arguments are passed in.  That's typically a good thing!

### 5. Fix the Program - Persons

Complete this program so that it produces the expected output:

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name.capitalize
    @last_name = last_name.capitalize
  end

  def to_s
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
end

person = Person.new('john', 'doe')
puts person

person.first_name = 'jane'
person.last_name = 'smith'
puts person
```
Expected output:

John Doe
Jane Smith

#### Solution:
```ruby
class Person

  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name.capitalize
    @last_name = last_name.capitalize
  end
  
  def first_name= (first_name)
    @first_name = first_name.capitalize
  end
  
  def last_name= (last_name)
    @last_name = last_name.capitalize
  end

  def to_s
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
end
```

### 6. Fix the Program - Flight Data

Consider the following class definition:

```ruby
class Flight
  attr_accessor :database_handle

  def initialize(flight_number)
    @database_handle = Database.init
    @flight_number = flight_number
  end
end
```

There is nothing technically incorrect about this class, but the definition may lead to problems in the future. How can this class be fixed to be resistant to future problems?

#### Solution:

The code allows getting and setting @database_handle, but it that necessary or wise? It is supposed to point to a Database object, and that is established at initialization.  To fix this, I'd just remove `attr_accessor :database_handle`.

Also, it would seem like a flight number is the sort of object one might need to change.  To allow this I'd add `attr_accessor :flight_number`.

### 7. Buggy Code - Car Mileage

Fix the following code so it works properly:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :mileage

  def initialize
    @mileage = 0
  end

  def increment_mileage(miles)
    total = mileage + miles
    mileage = total
  end

  def print_mileage
    puts mileage
  end
end

car = Car.new
car.mileage = 5000
car.increment_mileage(678)
car.print_mileage  # should print 5678
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :mileage

  def initialize
    @mileage = 0
  end

  def increment_mileage(miles)
    total = mileage + miles
    self.mileage = total
  end

  def print_mileage
    puts mileage
  end
end
```

### 8. Rectangles and Squares

Given the following class:

```ruby
class Rectangle
  def initialize(height, width)
    @height = height
    @width = width
  end

  def area
    @height * @width
  end
end
```

Write a class called Square that inherits from Rectangle, and is used like this:

```ruby
square = Square.new(5)
puts "area of square = #{square.area}"
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Square < Rectangle
  def initialize(side)
    super(side, side)
  end
end
```

### 9. Complete the Program - Cats!

Consider the following program.

```ruby
class Pet
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
end


pudding = Cat.new('Pudding', 7, 'black and white')
butterscotch = Cat.new('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white')
puts pudding, butterscotch
```

Update this code so that when you run it, you see the following output:

My cat Pudding is 7 years old and has black and white fur.
My cat Butterscotch is 10 years old and has tan and white fur.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Pet
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
  def initialize(name, age, colors)
    super(name, age)
    @colors = colors
  end
  
  def to_s
    "My cat #{@name} is #{@age} years old and has #{@colors} fur."
  end
end
```

#### Further Exploration
An alternative approach to this problem would be to modify the Pet class to accept a colors parameter. If we did this, we wouldn't need to supply an initialize method for Cat.

Why would we be able to omit the initialize method? Would it be a good idea to modify Pet in this way? Why or why not? How might you deal with some of the problems, if any, that might arise from modifying Pet?

####  Solution:

If all the instance variables were set by the parent class, then we would not need to have a distinct Cat `initialize` method, because the values would be set 'higher up'.  This might cause problems in the future; is it really true that all pets have the same types of state that we want to track?  If `@colors` is pushed up to the Pet class, what happens when we need to define a Chameleon class?

### 10. Refactoring Vehicles

Consider the following classes:

```ruby 
class Car
  attr_reader :make, :model

  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end

  def wheels
    4
  end

  def to_s
    "#{make} #{model}"
  end
end

class Motorcycle
  attr_reader :make, :model

  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end

  def wheels
    2
  end

  def to_s
    "#{make} #{model}"
  end
end

class Truck
  attr_reader :make, :model, :payload

  def initialize(make, model, payload)
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @payload = payload
  end

  def wheels
    6
  end

  def to_s
    "#{make} #{model}"
  end
end
```

Refactor these classes so they all use a common superclass, and inherit behavior as needed.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Vehicle
  attr_reader :make, :model

  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end

  def to_s
    "#{make} #{model}"
  end
end


class Car < Vehicle
  
  def wheels
    4
  end
end

class Motorcycle < Vehicle
  def wheels
    2
  end
end

class Truck < Vehicle
  attr_reader :payload

  def initialize(make, model, payload)
    super(make, model)
    @payload = payload
  end

  def wheels
    6
  end
end
```
