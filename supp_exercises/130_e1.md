130: Ruby Foundations: More Topics
[Easy 1](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/f55e7ba0)

### 1. Enumerable Class Creation

Assume we have a `Tree` class that implements a binary tree.

```ruby
class Tree
  ...
end
```

A binary tree is just one of many forms of collections, such as Arrays, Hashes, Stacks, Sets, and more. All of these collection classes include the `Enumerable` module, which means they have access to an `each` method, as well as many other iterative methods such as `map`, `reduce`, `select`, and more.

For this exercise, modify the `Tree` class to support the methods of `Enumerable`. You do not have to actually implement any methods -- just show the methods that you must provide.

#### Solution:
```ruby
class Tree
  include Enumerable
  
  def each
    # implementation ...
  end
  
  # additional code ...
end
```

### 2. Optional Blocks

Write a method that takes an optional block. If the block is specified, the method should execute it, and return the value returned by the block. If no block is specified, the method should simply return the String 'Does not compute.'.

Examples:
```ruby
compute { 5 + 3 } == 8
compute { 'a' + 'b' } == 'ab'
compute == 'Does not compute.'
```

#### Solution:

```ruby 
def compute
  block_given? ? yield : 'Does not compute.'
end
```

or

```ruby
def compute
  return 'Does not compute.' unless block_given?
  yield
end
```

#### Further Exploration:

Modify the `compute` method so it takes a single argument and yields that argument to the block. Provide at least 3 examples of calling this new version of `compute`, including a no-block call.

#### Solution:

```ruby
def compute(input)
  block_given? ? yield(input) : "All I have to work with is #{input}."
end

puts compute(5) { |n| n * 5 }
puts compute(10) { |n| n * 4 }
puts compute('hi ') { |str| str * 10 }
puts compute(11)
```

### 3. Find Missing Numbers

Write a method that takes a sorted array of integers as an argument, and returns an array that includes all of the missing integers (in order) between the first and last elements of the argument.

Examples:
```ruby
missing([-3, -2, 1, 5]) == [-1, 0, 2, 3, 4]
missing([1, 2, 3, 4]) == []
missing([1, 5]) == [2, 3, 4]
missing([6]) == []
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
def missing(sorted_array)
  range = (sorted_array.first..sorted_array.last).to_a
  index = 0
  while index < range.length
    if sorted_array.include?(range[index])
      range.delete_at(index) 
      next
    end
    index += 1
  end
  range
end

missing([-3, -2, 1, 5]) == [-1, 0, 2, 3, 4]
missing([1, 2, 3, 4]) == []
missing([1, 5]) == [2, 3, 4]
missing([6]) == []
```

#### Further Exploration

Can you find other ways to solve this problem? What methods might prove useful? Can you find a way to solve this without using a method that requires a block?

#### Solution

My original solution addresses the desiderata of Further Explorations, but here is one more:
```ruby
def missing(array)
  range = (array.first..array.last).to_a
  range.delete_if { |n| array.include?(n) }
end
```

### 4. Divisors

Write a method that returns a list of all of the divisors of the positive integer passed in as an argument. The return value can be in any sequence you wish.

Examples
```ruby
divisors(1) == [1]
divisors(7) == [1, 7]
divisors(12) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
divisors(98) == [1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98]
divisors(99400891) == [1, 9967, 9973, 99400891] # may take a minute
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
def divisors(integer)
  divs = []
  (1..integer).each do |n|
    divs << n if (integer % n).zero?
  end
  divs
end

# or

def divisors(integer)
  (1..integer).select { |n| (integer % n).zero? }
end

divisors(1) == [1]
divisors(7) == [1, 7]
divisors(12) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
divisors(98) == [1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98]
divisors(99400891) == [1, 9967, 9973, 99400891] # may take a minute
```

#### Further Exploration
How fast can you make your solution go? How big of a number can you quickly reduce to its divisors? Can you make divisors(999962000357) return almost instantly? (The divisors are [1, 999979, 999983, 999962000357].) Hint: half of the divisors gives you the other half.

Solution:
```ruby 

```

#### 5. Encrypted Pioneers

The following list contains the names of individuals who are pioneers in the field of computing or that have had a significant influence on the field. However, the names are in an encrypted form, using a very simple (and incredibly weak) form of encryption called rot 13.

Write a program that deciphers and prints each of these names:

Nqn Ybirynpr
Tenpr Ubccre
Nqryr Tbyqfgvar
Nyna Ghevat
Puneyrf Onoontr
Noqhyynu Zhunzznq ova Zhfn ny-Xujnevmzv
Wbua Ngnanfbss
Ybvf Unyog
Pynhqr Funaaba
Fgrir Wbof
Ovyy Tngrf
Gvz Orearef-Yrr
Fgrir Jbmavnx
Xbaenq Mhfr
Wbua Ngnanfbss
Fve Nagbal Ubner
Zneiva Zvafxl
Lhxvuveb Zngfhzbgb
Unllvz Fybavzfxv
Tregehqr Oynapu

#### Solution:

```ruby
encoded_names = [
                "Nqn Ybirynpr", "Tenpr Ubccre", "Nqryr Tbyqfgvar",
                "Nyna Ghevat", "Puneyrf Onoontr", 
                "Noqhyynu Zhunzznq ova Zhfn ny-Xujnevmzv", "Wbua Ngnanfbss",
                "Ybvf Unyog", "Pynhqr Funaaba", "Fgrir Wbof", "Ovyy Tngrf",
                "Gvz Orearef-Yrr", "Fgrir Jbmavnx", "Xbaenq Mhfr",
                "Wbua Ngnanfbss", "Fve Nagbal Ubner", "Zneiva Zvafxl", 
                "Lhxvuveb Zngfhzbgb", "Unllvz Fybavzfxv", "Tregehqr Oynapu"
              ]

rot13_cipher = {
               "a"=>"n", "b"=>"o", "c"=>"p", "d"=>"q", "e"=>"r",
               "f"=>"s", "g"=>"t", "h"=>"u", "i"=>"v", "j"=>"w",
               "k"=>"x", "l"=>"y", "m"=>"z", "n"=>"a", "o"=>"b",
               "p"=>"c", "q"=>"d", "r"=>"e", "s"=>"f", "t"=>"g",
               "u"=>"h", "v"=>"i", "w"=>"j", "x"=>"k", "y"=>"l",
               "z"=>"m"
              }

def decode(string, cipher)

  decoded_chars = []

  string.each_char do |char|
    decoded_chars.push(char) unless cipher.keys.include?(char.downcase)
    if char == char.downcase
      decoded_chars.push(cipher[char])
    else
      decoded_chars.push(cipher[char.downcase].upcase)
    end
  end

  decoded_chars.join
end

encoded_names.map do |name|
  puts decode(name, rot13_cipher)
end
```
or

```ruby
def decrypt(array)
  array.map { |string| rot13_decrypt(string) }
end

def rot13_decrypt(string)
  uncoded = ''
  string.chars.each do |char|
    if char.match(/[a-m]/i)
      uncoded << (char.ord + 13).chr
    elsif char.match(/[n-z]/i)
      uncoded << (char.ord - 13).chr
    else
      uncoded << char
    end
  end
  uncoded
end
```

#### Further Exploration

[The sample solution used string#ord and shifted 13 spots in one direction or the other, depending on the placement of the encoded letter. This assumes the ASCII encoding.]

Not all computers use ASCII, however. Many mainframes use different schemes such as EBCDIC, which is found on some IBM computers. EBCDIC is unusual: the alphabetic characters are not all grouped together like in ASCII (see the linked page). How would this impact our implementation of this program if we were running this program on data that uses the EBCDIC representation?

#### Solution:

If the character encoding didn't group all letters in a series, then one solution would be to use a look-up hash, as I did above.  It is also possible that there may be a pattern in the way the letters are stored.  If that is the case then perhaps a modified version of the 'shift 13 spots' may work.

#### 6. Iterators: True for Any?

The Enumerable#any? method processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns a value of true for any element, then #any? returns true. Otherwise, #any? returns false. Note in particular that #any? will stop searching the collection the first time the block returns true.

Write a method called any? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns true for any of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns true.

If the Array is empty, any? should return false, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any standard ruby method that is named all?, any?, none?, or one?.

```ruby 
any?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == true
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.even? } == false
any?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.odd? } == false
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == true
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == true
any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == false
any?([]) { |value| true } == false
```

#### Solution:
```ruby
def any?(array)
  index = 0
  while index < array.length
    return true if yield(array[index])
    index += 1
  end

  false
end

puts any?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } # == true
puts any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.even? } # == false
puts any?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.odd? } # == false
puts any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } # == true
puts any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } # == true
puts any?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } # == false
puts any?([]) { |value| true } # == false
```

#### Further Explorations:
Does my method work for other Enumerables? The sample solution does because it calls #each on the array, and #each could just as well be Hash#each, if a hash were being passed in.

#### Solution:
No, my original solution only works for arrays.  Because I looped manually through the collection using index incrementation, my method would need to be adapted to work with a non-indexed collection.

My revision below should work with other Enumerables because it uses `#each`.

```ruby 
def any?(array)
  array.each do |element|
    return true if yield(element)
  end
  false
end
```


#### 7. Iterators: True for All?

Enumerable#all? processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns a value of true for every element, then #all? returns true. Otherwise, #all? returns false. Note in particular that #all? will stop searching the collection the first time the block returns false.

Write a method called all? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns true for all of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns false.

If the Array is empty, all? should return true, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any standard ruby method that is named all?, any?, none?, or one?.


```ruby
all?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.odd? } == false
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.odd? } == true
all?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.even? } == true
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == false
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == true
all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == false
all?([]) { |value| false } == true
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
def all?(collection)
  collection.each do |item|
    return false unless yield(item)
  end
  true
end

puts all?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.odd? } == false
puts all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.odd? } == true
puts all?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.even? } == true
puts all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == false
puts all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == true
puts all?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == false
puts all?([]) { |value| false } == true
```

#### 8. Iterators: True for None?

In the previous two exercises, you developed methods called any? and all? that are similar to the standard Enumerable methods with the same names. In this exercise, you will develop another of the methods in this family, none?.

Enumerable#none? processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns true for any element, then #none? returns false. Otherwise, #none? returns true. Note in particular that #none? will stop searching the collection the first time the block returns true.

Write a method called none? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns false for all of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns true.

If the Array is empty, none? should return true, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any of the following methods from the Array and Enumerable classes: all?, any?, none?, one?. You may, however, use either of the methods created in the previous two exercises.

Examples:

```ruby 
none?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == false
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.even? } == true
none?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.odd? } == true
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == false
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == false
none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == true
none?([]) { |value| true } == true
```

#### Solution:
```ruby
def none?(collection)
  collection.each do |item|
    return false if yield(item)
  end
  true
end

puts none?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? } == false
puts none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.even? } == true
puts none?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.odd? } == true
puts none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } == false
puts none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true } == false
puts none?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false } == true
puts none?([]) { |value| true } == true
```

The following would also work.  Note the necessity of explicitly passing in a block for `none?` to call `any?`.

```ruby
def any?(array)
  array.each { |ele| return true if yield(ele) }
  false
end

def none?(array, &block)
  !any?(array, &block)
end
```

#### 9. Iterators: True for One?

Enumerable#one? processes elements in a collection by passing each element value to a block that is provided in the method call. If the block returns a value of true for exactly one element, then #one? returns true. Otherwise, #one? returns false. Note in particular that #one? will stop searching the collection the second time the block returns true.

Write a method called one? that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return true if the block returns true for exactly one of the element values. Otherwise, it should return false.

Your method should stop processing elements of the Array as soon as the block returns true a second time.

If the Array is empty, one? should return false, regardless of how the block is defined.

Your method may not use any standard ruby method that is named all?, any?, none?, or one?.

Examples:
```ruby
one?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? }    # -> true
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.odd? }     # -> false
one?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.even? }    # -> false
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } # -> true
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true }           # -> false
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false }          # -> false
one?([]) { |value| true }                     # -> false
```

#### Solution:

```ruby

def one?(collection)
  counter = 0
  collection.each do |item|
    counter += 1 if yield(item)
    return false if counter == 2
  end
  counter == 1
end

one?([1, 3, 5, 6]) { |value| value.even? }    # -> true
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value.odd? }     # -> false
one?([2, 4, 6, 8]) { |value| value.even? }    # -> false
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| value % 5 == 0 } # -> true
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| true }           # -> false
one?([1, 3, 5, 7]) { |value| false }          # -> false
one?([]) { |value| true }                     # -> false
```

#### 10. Count Items

Write a method that takes an array as an argument, and a block that returns true or false depending on the value of the array element passed to it. The method should return a count of the number of times the block returns true.

You may not use Array#count or Enumerable#count in your solution.

Examples:
```ruby
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| value.odd? } == 3
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| value % 3 == 1 } == 2
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| true } == 5
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| false } == 0
count([]) { |value| value.even? } == 0
count(%w(Four score and seven)) { |value| value.size == 5 } == 2
```

#### Solution:
```ruby 
def count(collection)
  trues = 0
  collection.each do |item|
    trues += 1 if yield(item)
  end
  trues
end

count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| value.odd? } == 3
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| value % 3 == 1 } == 2
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| true } == 5
count([1,2,3,4,5]) { |value| false } == 0
count([]) { |value| value.even? } == 0
count(%w(Four score and seven)) { |value| value.size == 5 } == 2
```
