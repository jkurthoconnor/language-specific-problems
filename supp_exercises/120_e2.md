120: Object Oriented Programming
 [Easy 2](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/a40ef2dc)
 
### 1. Fix the Program - Mailable

Correct the following program so it will work properly. Assume that the Customer and Employee classes have complete implementations; just make the smallest possible change to ensure that objects of both types have access to the print_address method.

```ruby
module Mailable
  def print_address
    puts "#{name}"
    puts "#{address}"
    puts "#{city}, #{state} #{zipcode}"
  end
end

class Customer
  attr_reader :name, :address, :city, :state, :zipcode
end

class Employee
  attr_reader :name, :address, :city, :state, :zipcode
end

betty = Customer.new 
bob = Employee.new
betty.print_address
bob.print_address
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
module Mailable
  def print_address
    puts "#{name}"
    puts "#{address}"
    puts "#{city}, #{state} #{zipcode}"
  end
end

class Customer
  include Mailable

  attr_reader :name, :address, :city, :state, :zipcode
end

class Employee
  include Mailable

  attr_reader :name, :address, :city, :state, :zipcode
end
```

### 2. Fix the Program - Drivable

Correct the following program so it will work properly. Assume that the Car class has a complete implementation; just make the smallest possible change to ensure that cars have access to the drive method.

```ruby
module Drivable
  def self.drive
  end
end

class Car
  include Drivable
end

bobs_car = Car.new
bobs_car.drive
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
module Drivable
  def drive
  end
end

class Car
  include Drivable
end

bobs_car = Car.new
bobs_car.drive
```

### 3. Complete The Program - Houses

Assume you have the following code:

```ruby
class House
  attr_reader :price

  def initialize(price)
    @price = price
  end
end

home1 = House.new(100_000)
home2 = House.new(150_000)
puts "Home 1 is cheaper" if home1 < home2
puts "Home 2 is more expensive" if home2 > home1

# and this output:

Home 1 is cheaper
Home 2 is more expensive
```

Modify the House class so that the above program will work. You are permitted to define only one new method in House.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class House
  attr_reader :price
  include Comparable

  def initialize(price)
    @price = price
  end

  def <=>(other_home)
    price <=> other_home.price
  end
end

home1 = House.new(100_000)
home2 = House.new(150_000)
puts home1
puts "Home 1 is cheaper" if home1 < home2
puts "Home 2 is more expensive" if home2 > home1
```

### 4. Reverse Engineering

Write a class that will display:
  ABC
  xyz

when the following code is run:

```ruby
my_data = Transform.new('abc')
puts my_data.uppercase
puts Transform.lowercase('XYZ')
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Transform
  attr_reader :string

  def initialize(string)
    @string = string
  end
  
  def uppercase
    string.upcase
  end

  def self.lowercase(string)
    string.downcase
  end
end
```

### 5. What Will This Do?

What will the following code print?

```ruby
class Something
  def initialize
    @data = 'Hello'
  end

  def dupdata
    @data + @data
  end

  def self.dupdata
    'ByeBye'
  end
end

thing = Something.new
puts Something.dupdata
puts thing.dupdata
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
ByeBye
HelloHello
```

### 6. Comparing Wallets

Consider the following broken code:

```ruby
class Wallet
  include Comparable

  def initialize(amount)
    @amount = amount
  end

  def <=>(other_wallet)
    amount <=> other_wallet.amount
  end
end

bills_wallet = Wallet.new(500)
pennys_wallet = Wallet.new(465)
if bills_wallet > pennys_wallet
  puts 'Bill has more money than Penny'
elsif bills_wallet < pennys_wallet
  puts 'Penny has more money than Bill'
else
  puts 'Bill and Penny have the same amount of money.'
end
```

Modify this code so it works. Do not make the amount in the wallet accessible to any method that isn't part of the Wallet class.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Wallet
  include Comparable

  def initialize(amount)
    @amount = amount
  end

  def <=>(other_wallet)
    amount <=> other_wallet.amount
  end

  protected
  attr_reader :amount
end
```

#### Further Exploration

This example is rather contrived and unrealistic, but this type of situation occurs frequently in applications. Can you think of any applications where protected methods would be desirable?

#### Solution

Off the top of my head I'd say that healthcare and educational records would benefit from protected methods.  Typically, if you need to work with potentially sensitive data but do not want it exposed to reading or writing at invocation, protected methods would offer a solution.

### 7. Pet Shelter

Consider the following code:

```ruby
butterscotch = Pet.new('cat', 'Butterscotch')
pudding      = Pet.new('cat', 'Pudding')
darwin       = Pet.new('bearded dragon', 'Darwin')
kennedy      = Pet.new('dog', 'Kennedy')
sweetie      = Pet.new('parakeet', 'Sweetie Pie')
molly        = Pet.new('dog', 'Molly')
chester      = Pet.new('fish', 'Chester')

phanson = Owner.new('P Hanson')
bholmes = Owner.new('B Holmes')

shelter = Shelter.new
shelter.adopt(phanson, butterscotch)
shelter.adopt(phanson, pudding)
shelter.adopt(phanson, darwin)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, kennedy)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, sweetie)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, molly)
shelter.adopt(bholmes, chester)
shelter.print_adoptions
puts "#{phanson.name} has #{phanson.number_of_pets} adopted pets."
puts "#{bholmes.name} has #{bholmes.number_of_pets} adopted pets."
```
Write the classes and methods that will be necessary to make this code run, and print the following output:

```ruby
P Hanson has adopted the following pets:
a cat named Butterscotch
a cat named Pudding
a bearded dragon named Darwin

B Holmes has adopted the following pets:
a dog named Molly
a parakeet named Sweetie Pie
a dog named Kennedy
a fish named Chester

P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.
```

The order of the output does not matter, so long as all of the information is presented.

#### Solution:

```ruby 
class Pet
  attr_reader :type, :name

  def initialize(type, name)
    @type = type
    @name = name
  end
  
  def to_s
    "a #{type} named #{name}"
  end
end

class Owner
  attr_reader :name, :pets

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @pets = []
  end

  def number_of_pets
    pets.size
  end
end

class Shelter
  attr_reader :adoptors

  def initialize
    @adoptors = []
  end

  def adopt(owner, pet)
    owner.pets << pet
    adoptors << owner unless adoptors.include?(owner)
  end

  def print_adoptions
    adoptors.each do |person|
      puts "#{person.name} has adopted the following pets:" 
      person.pets.each do |pet|
        puts pet
      end
      puts ''
    end
  end
end
```

#### Further Exploration

Add your own name and pets to this project.

Suppose the shelter has a number of not-yet-adopted pets, and wants to manage them through this same system. Thus, you should be able to add the following output to the example output shown above:

The Animal Shelter has the following unadopted pets:
a dog named Asta
a dog named Laddie
a cat named Fluffy
a cat named Kat
a cat named Ben
a parakeet named Chatterbox
a parakeet named Bluebell
   ...

P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.
The Animal shelter has 7 unadopted pets.

Can you make these updates to your solution? Did you need to change your class system at all? Were you able to make all of your changes without modifying the existing interface?

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Pet
  attr_reader :type, :name

  def initialize(type, name)
    @type = type
    @name = name
  end
  
  def to_s
    "a #{type} named #{name}"
  end
end

class Owner
  attr_reader :name, :pets

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @pets = []
  end

  def number_of_pets
    pets.size
  end
end

class Shelter
  attr_reader :adoptors, :unadopted_pets

  def initialize
    @adoptors = []
    @unadopted_pets = []
  end

  def rescue_abandoned_pet(pet)
    @unadopted_pets << pet
  end
  
  def adopt(owner, pet)
    owner.pets << pet
    adoptors << owner unless adoptors.include?(owner)
  end

  def print_adoptions
    adoptors.each do |person|
      puts "#{person.name} has adopted the following pets:" 
      person.pets.each do |pet|
        puts pet
      end
      puts ''
    end
  end

  def print_available_pets
    puts "The Animal Shelter has the following unadopted pets:" 
    unadopted_pets.each do |pet|
      puts pet
    end
    puts ''
  end

  def number_of_pets_available
    unadopted_pets.size
  end
end
```

### 8. Fix The Program - Expander

What is wrong with the following code? What fix(es) would you make?

```ruby
class Expander
  def initialize(string)
    @string = string
  end

  def to_s
    self.expand(3)
  end

  private

  def expand(n)
    @string * n
  end
end

expander = Expander.new('xyz')
puts expander
```

#### Solution:

`expand` is a private method, so `to_s` can't call it. Running the code will throw a `NoMethodError`. The simplest fix is to change `private` to `protected`.  One could also keep the private method and instead drop the explicit `self` caller from `expand`.

```ruby
class Expander
  def initialize(string)
    @string = string
  end

  def to_s
    expand(3)
  end

  private

  def expand(n)
    @string * n
  end
end

expander = Expander.new('xyz')
puts expander
```

### 9. Moving

You have the following classes.
```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end


class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end
```
You need to modify the code so that this works:
```ruby
mike = Person.new("Mike")
mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"
```
You are only allowed to write one new method to do this

#### Solution:

```ruby
module Moveable
  def walk
    "#{name} #{gait} forward"
  end
end

class Person
  attr_reader :name

  include Moveable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  include Moveable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  include Moveable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end
```


### 10. Nobility

Now that we have a Walkable module, we are given a new challenge. Apparently some of our users are nobility, and the regular way of walking simply isn't good enough. Nobility need to strut.

We need a new class Noble that shows the title and name when walk is called:

```ruby
byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
p byron.walk
# => "Lord Byron struts forward"
```

We must have access to both name and title because they are needed for other purposes that we aren't showing here.
```ruby
byron.name
=> "Byron"
byron.title
=> "Lord"
```

Approach/Algorithim

The easiest way to accomplish this is to provide a method that returns both the title and name objects of the Noble class, and just the name for other classes.

#### Solution:

```ruby
module Moveable
  def walk
    "#{get_walking_name} #{gait} forward"
  end

  def get_walking_name
    return "#{@title} #{@name}" if self.is_a?(Noble)
    @name
  end
end

class Noble
  attr_reader :name, :title

  include Moveable

  def initialize(name, title)
    @name = name
    @title = title
  end

  private

  def gait
    "struts"
  end
end

class Person
  attr_reader :name

  include Moveable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  attr_reader :name

  include Moveable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  attr_reader :name

  include Moveable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end
```
