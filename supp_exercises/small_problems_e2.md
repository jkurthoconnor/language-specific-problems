### How old is Teddy?
Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age. To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 200.

Example Output:

```ruby
Teddy is 69 years old!
```

#### Solution: 

```ruby
def age(person)
  puts "#{person} is #{rand(181) + 20} years old!"
end

age('Teddy')
```

Further Explorations:
Modify this program to ask for a name, and then print the age for that person. For an extra challenge, use "Teddy" as the name if no name is entered.

```ruby

def age
  puts "Whose age are you requesting?"
  person = gets.chomp
  person = 'Teddy' if person.length == 0
  puts "#{person} is #{rand(181) + 20} years old!"
end

age
```
