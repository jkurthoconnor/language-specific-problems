120 Object Oriented Programming [Medium 1](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/e0cc58f8)

### 1. Privacy

Consider the following class:
```ruby
class Machine
  attr_writer :switch

  def start
    self.flip_switch(:on)
  end

  def stop
    self.flip_switch(:off)
  end

  def flip_switch(desired_state)
    self.switch = desired_state
  end
end
```

Modify this class so both flip_switch and the setter method switch= are private methods.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Machine

  def start
    flip_switch(:on)
  end

  def stop
    flip_switch(:off)
  end

  private

  attr_writer :switch

  def flip_switch(desired_state)
    self.switch = desired_state
  end
end
```

#### Further Exploration

Add a private getter for `@switch` to the Machine class, and add a method to Machine that shows how to use that getter.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Machine

  def start
    flip_switch(:on)
  end

  def stop
    flip_switch(:off)
  end

  def return_status
    switch
  end

  private

  attr_accessor :switch

  def flip_switch(desired_state)
    self.switch = desired_state
  end
end

mac = Machine.new
mac.start
p mac.return_status
mac.stop
p mac.return_status
```

### 2. Fixed Array

A fixed-length array is an array that always has a fixed number of elements. Write a class that implements a fixed-length array, and provides the necessary methods to support the following code:

```ruby
fixed_array = FixedArray.new(5)
puts fixed_array[3] == nil
puts fixed_array.to_a == [nil] * 5

fixed_array[3] = 'a'
puts fixed_array[3] == 'a'
puts fixed_array.to_a == [nil, nil, nil, 'a', nil]

fixed_array[1] = 'b'
puts fixed_array[1] == 'b'
puts fixed_array.to_a == [nil, 'b', nil, 'a', nil]

fixed_array[1] = 'c'
puts fixed_array[1] == 'c'
puts fixed_array.to_a == [nil, 'c', nil, 'a', nil]

fixed_array[4] = 'd'
puts fixed_array[4] == 'd'
puts fixed_array.to_a == [nil, 'c', nil, 'a', 'd']
puts fixed_array.to_s == '[nil, "c", nil, "a", "d"]'

puts fixed_array[-1] == 'd'
puts fixed_array[-4] == 'c'

begin
  fixed_array[6]
  puts false
rescue IndexError
  puts true
end

begin
  fixed_array[-7] = 3
  puts false
rescue IndexError
  puts true
end
```

The above code should output true 15 times.

### Solution:

```ruby
class FixedArray

  def initialize(size)
    @array = Array.new(size)
  end

  def to_a
    @array.clone
  end
  
  def to_s
    to_a.to_s
  end
  
  def [](index)
    raise IndexError if index > @array.size - 1
    @array[index]
  end
  
  def []=(index, value)
    raise IndexError if index > @array.size - 1
    @array[index] = value
  end
end
```

or using an index validating method

```ruby
class FixedArray
  attr_reader :array

  def initialize(size)
    @array = Array.new(size)
  end

  def []=(index, value)
    raise IndexError if out_of_bounds_index?(index)
    @array[index] = value
  end

  def [](index)
    raise IndexError if out_of_bounds_index?(index)
    array[index]
  end

  def to_a
    array.clone
  end

  def to_s
    to_a.to_s
  end

  private

  def out_of_bounds_index?(index)
    index >= array.length || index < -array.length
  end
end
```

### 3. Students

Below we have 3 classes: Student, Graduate, and Undergraduate. Some details for these classes are missing. Make changes to the classes below so that the following requirements are fulfilled:

Graduate students have the option to use on-campus parking, while Undergraduate students do not.

Graduate and Undergraduate students have a name and year associated with them.

Note, you can do this by adding or altering no more than 5 lines of code.

```ruby
class Student
  def initialize(name, year)
    @name = name
    @year = year
  end
end

class Graduate
  def initialize(name, year, parking)
  end
end

class Undergraduate
  def initialize(name, year)
  end
end
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Student
  def initialize(name, year)
    @name = name
    @year = year
  end
end

class Graduate < Student
  def initialize(name, year, parking)
    super(name, year)
    @parking_location = parking
  end
end

class Undergraduate < Student
  def initialize(name, year) 
    #were it not for the '5 line changes only' constraint, `initialize` should be removed, as it is inherited from Student 
    super
  end
end
```


### 4. Circular Queue

A circular queue is a collection of objects stored in a buffer that is treated as though it is connected end-to-end in a circle. When an object is added to this circular queue, it is added to the position that immediately follows the most recently added object, while removing an object always removes the object that has been in the queue the longest.

This works as long as there are empty spots in the buffer. If the buffer becomes full, adding a new object to the queue requires getting rid of an existing object; with a circular queue, the object that has been in the queue the longest is discarded and replaced by the new object.

Assuming we have a circular queue with room for 3 objects, the circular queue looks and acts like this:
P1	P2	P3	Comments
            All positions are initially empty
1			      Add 1 to the queue
1	2		      Add 2 to the queue
2		        Remove oldest item from the queue (1)
2	3	        Add 3 to the queue
4	2	3	      Add 4 to the queue, queue is now full
4		3	      Remove oldest item from the queue (2)
4	5	3	      Add 5 to the queue, queue is full again
4	5	6	      Add 6 to the queue, replaces oldest element (3)
7	5	6	      Add 7 to the queue, replaces oldest element (4)
7		6	      Remove oldest item from the queue (5)
7			      Remove oldest item from the queue (6)
            Remove oldest item from the queue (7)
            Remove non-existent item from the queue (nil)
            
Your task is to write a CircularQueue class that implements a circular queue for arbitrary objects. The class should obtain the buffer size with an argument provided to CircularQueue::new, and should provide the following methods:

`enqueue` to add an object to the queue
`dequeue` to remove (and return) the oldest object in the queue. It should return nil if the queue is empty.
You may assume that none of the values stored in the queue are nil (however, nil may be used to designate empty spots in the buffer).

Examples:

```ruby
queue = CircularQueue.new(3)
puts queue.dequeue == nil

queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
puts queue.dequeue == 1

queue.enqueue(3)
queue.enqueue(4)
puts queue.dequeue == 2

queue.enqueue(5)
queue.enqueue(6)
queue.enqueue(7)
puts queue.dequeue == 5
puts queue.dequeue == 6
puts queue.dequeue == 7
puts queue.dequeue == nil

queue = CircularQueue.new(4)
puts queue.dequeue == nil

queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
puts queue.dequeue == 1

queue.enqueue(3)
queue.enqueue(4)
puts queue.dequeue == 2

queue.enqueue(5)
queue.enqueue(6)
queue.enqueue(7)
puts queue.dequeue == 4
puts queue.dequeue == 5
puts queue.dequeue == 6
puts queue.dequeue == 7
puts queue.dequeue == nil
```
The above code should display true 15 times.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class CircularQueue

  def initialize(size)
    @max_size = size
    @queue = Array.new(size)
    @addition_history = []
  end

  def enqueue(value)
    dequeue if full?(queue)
    @insert_pt = queue.index(nil)
    queue.delete_at(@insert_pt)
    queue.insert(@insert_pt, value)
    update_addition_history
  end

  def dequeue
    return nil if queue.count(nil) == max_size
    oldest = @addition_history.shift
    queue.insert(oldest, nil)
    queue.delete_at(oldest + 1)
  end

  def update_addition_history
    addition_history.shift if full?(addition_history)
    addition_history.push(@insert_pt)
  end

  def full?(array)
    !array.include?(nil) && array.length == max_size
  end

  private

  attr_reader :queue, :max_size, :addition_history
end
```

#### Further Exploration

Phew. That's a lot of work, but it's a perfectly acceptable solution to this exercise. However, there is a simpler solution that uses an Array, and the #push and #shift methods. See if you can up with a solution that does this.

#### Solution:

My solution already appears to meet the requirements of the Further Exploration.

### 5. Minilang

Write a class that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based programming language that has the following commands:

  - n Place a value n in the "register". Do not modify the stack.
  - PUSH Push the register value on to the stack. Leave the value in the register.
  - ADD Pops a value from the stack and adds it to the register value, storing the result in the register.
  - SUB Pops a value from the stack and subtracts it from the register value, storing the result in the register.
  - MULT Pops a value from the stack and multiplies it by the register value, storing the result in the register.
  - DIV Pops a value from the stack and divides it into the register value, storing the integer result in the register.
  - MOD Pops a value from the stack and divides it into the register value, storing the integer remainder of the division in the register.
  - POP Remove the topmost item from the stack and place in register
  - PRINT Print the register value
  - All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and MOD).

Programs will be supplied to your language method via a string passed in as an argument. Your program should produce an error if an unexpected item is present in the string, or if a required stack value is not on the stack when it should be (the stack is empty). In all error cases, no further processing should be performed on the program.

You should initialize the register to 0.

Examples:

```ruby
Minilang.new('PRINT').eval
# 0

Minilang.new('5 PUSH 3 MULT PRINT').eval
# 15

Minilang.new('5 PRINT PUSH 3 PRINT ADD PRINT').eval
# 5
# 3
# 8

Minilang.new('5 PUSH 10 PRINT POP PRINT').eval
# 10
# 5

Minilang.new('5 PUSH POP POP PRINT').eval
# Empty stack!

Minilang.new('3 PUSH PUSH 7 DIV MULT PRINT ').eval
# 6

Minilang.new('4 PUSH PUSH 7 MOD MULT PRINT ').eval
# 12

Minilang.new('-3 PUSH 5 XSUB PRINT').eval
# Invalid token: XSUB

Minilang.new('-3 PUSH 5 SUB PRINT').eval
# 8

Minilang.new('6 PUSH').eval
# (nothing printed; no PRINT commands)
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Minilang
  attr_reader :register, :stack, :inputs, :command

  def initialize(string)
    @stack = []
    @register = 0
    @inputs = string.split
    @command = nil
  end

  def eval
    @inputs.each do |input|
      if /\d/=~(input)
        @register = input.to_i
      else
        @command = input
        execute
      end
    end
  end

  def execute
    case command
    when 'PRINT' then output
    when 'PUSH' then push
    when 'MULT' then mult
    when 'ADD' then add
    when 'POP' then pop
    when 'DIV' then div
    when 'MOD' then mod
    when 'SUB' then subtract
    else raise "Invalid token: #{command}"
    end
  end

  def output
    puts register
  end

  def stack_error
    raise "Empty stack!" 
  end

  def push
    stack.push(register)
  end

  def pop
    stack.empty? ? stack_error : @register = stack.pop
  end

  def mult
    stack.empty? ? stack_error : @register *= stack.pop
  end

  def div
    stack.empty? ? stack_error : @register /= stack.pop
  end

  def mod
    stack.empty? ? stack_error : @register %= stack.pop
  end

  def add
    stack.empty? ? stack_error : @register += stack.pop
  end

  def subtract
    stack.empty? ? stack_error : @register -= stack.pop
  end
end
```



### 6. Number Guesser Part 1

Create an object-oriented number guessing class for numbers in the range 1 to 100, with a maximum limit of 7 guesses per game. The game should play like this:

```ruby
game = PingGame.new
game.play

You have 7 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 104
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 1 and 100: 50
Your guess is too low

You have 6 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 75
Your guess is too low

You have 5 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 85
Your guess is too high

You have 4 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 0
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 1 and 100: 80

You have 3 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 81
Your guess is too low
You win!

game.play

You have 7 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 50
Your guess is too high

You have 6 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 25
Your guess is too low

You have 5 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 37
Your guess is too high

You have 4 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 31
Your guess is too low

You have 3 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 34
Your guess is too high

You have 2 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 32
Your guess is too low

You have 1 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 32
Your guess is too low
You are out of guesses. You lose.
```

Note that a game object should start a new game with a new number to guess with each call to #play.

#### Solution:

```ruby
class PingGame
  attr_reader :number, :guesses_made, :current_guess, :guess_status

  MAX = 100
  MIN = 1
  TOTAL_GUESSES = 7

  def set_values
    @number = rand(MIN..MAX)
    @guesses_made = 0
    @current_guess = nil
    @guess_status = nil
  end

  def play
    set_values

    loop do
      announce_remaining_guesses
      solicit_guess
      puts evaluate_guess
      return if winner?
      break if guesses_depleted?
    end
    announce_loss
  end

  def announce_remaining_guesses
    left = TOTAL_GUESSES - guesses_made
    puts "\nYou have #{left} guesses remaining."
  end

  def solicit_guess
    loop do
      print "Enter a number between #{MIN} and #{MAX}: "
      input = gets.chomp.to_i
      if (MIN..MAX).include?(input)
        @current_guess = input
        @guesses_made += 1
        break
      end
      print "Invalid guess. "
    end
  end

  def evaluate_guess
    @guess_status = current_guess <=> number
    case guess_status
    when 0   then 'You win!'
    when -1  then 'Your guess is too low.'
    when 1   then 'Your guess is too high.'
    end
  end

  def winner?
   guess_status == 0
  end

  def guesses_depleted?
    guesses_made == TOTAL_GUESSES
  end

  def announce_loss
    puts "You are out of guesses.  You lose."
  end
end
```

### 7. Number Guesser Part 2

In the previous exercise, you wrote a number guessing game that determines a secret number between 1 and 100, and gives the user 7 opportunities to guess the number.

Modify your solution to accept a low and high value when the GuessingGame object is created, and use these values when computing a secret number for the game. You should also modify the maximum number of guesses so the user can always win if she uses a good strategy. This number can be computed as follows:

```ruby
Math.log2(size_of_range).to_i + 1
```

Examples:

```ruby
game = Guesser.new(501, 1500)
game.play

You have 10 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 104
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1000
Your guess is too low

You have 9 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1250
Your guess is too low

You have 8 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1375
Your guess is too high

You have 7 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 80
Invalid guess. Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1312
Your guess is too low

You have 6 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1343
Your guess is too low

You have 5 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1359
Your guess is too high

You have 4 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1351
Your guess is too high

You have 3 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1355
You win!

game.play
You have 10 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 1000
Your guess is too high

You have 9 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 750
Your guess is too low

You have 8 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 875
Your guess is too high

You have 7 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 812
Your guess is too low

You have 6 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 843
Your guess is too high

You have 5 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 820
Your guess is too low

You have 4 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 830
Your guess is too low

You have 3 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 835
Your guess is too low

You have 2 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 836
Your guess is too low

You have 1 guesses remaining.
Enter a number between 501 and 1500: 837
Your guess is too low

You are out of guesses. You lose.
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Guesser
  attr_reader :max, :min, :total_guesses, :number, :guesses_made, :current_guess, :guess_status

  def initialize(minimum, maximum)
    @min = minimum
    @max = maximum
    @total_guesses = Math.log2((min..max).size).to_i + 1    
  end

  def set_values
    @number = rand(min..max)
    @guesses_made = 0
    @current_guess = nil
    @guess_status = nil
  end

  def play
    set_values

    loop do
      announce_remaining_guesses
      solicit_guess
      puts evaluate_guess
      return if winner?
      break if guesses_depleted?
    end
    announce_loss
  end

  def announce_remaining_guesses
    left = total_guesses - guesses_made
    puts "\nYou have #{left} guesses remaining."
  end

  def solicit_guess
    loop do
      print "Enter a number between #{min} and #{max}: "
      input = gets.chomp.to_i
      if (min..max).include?(input)
        @current_guess = input
        @guesses_made += 1
        break
      end
      print "Invalid guess. "
    end
  end

  def evaluate_guess
    @guess_status = current_guess <=> number
    case guess_status
    when 0   then 'You win!'
    when -1  then 'Your guess is too low.'
    when 1   then 'Your guess is too high.'
    end
  end

  def winner?
   guess_status == 0
  end

  def guesses_depleted?
    guesses_made == total_guesses
  end

  def announce_loss
    puts "You are out of guesses.  You lose."
  end
end


game = Guesser.new(501, 1500)
game.play
```

### 8. Highest and Lowest Ranking Cards

Modify this class:

```ruby
class Card
  attr_reader :rank, :suit

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end
end
```

so that you can determine the lowest ranking and highest ranking Cards in an Array. For the purposes of this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2 through 10. Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks, Kings are higher than Queens, and Aces are higher than Kings. The suit plays no part in the relative ranking of cards.

If you have 2 or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min and max methods should return exactly one of the matching cards; it doesn't matter which one is returned.

In addition to any methods needed to determine the minimum and maximum, also create a #to_s method that converts cards to Strings of the form "Jack of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.

Examples:

```ruby
cards = [Card.new(2, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(10, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')]
puts cards
puts cards.min == Card.new(2, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(5, 'Hearts')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')

cards = [Card.new(4, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(4, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(10, 'Clubs')]
puts cards.min.rank == 4
puts cards.max == Card.new(10, 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(7, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Spades')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(7, 'Diamonds')
puts cards.max.rank == 'Jack'

cards = [Card.new(8, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(8, 'Clubs'),
         Card.new(8, 'Spades')]
puts cards.min.rank == 8
puts cards.max.rank == 8
Output:

2 of Hearts
10 of Diamonds
Ace of Clubs
true
true
true
true
true
true
true
true
true
true
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Card
  attr_reader :rank, :suit
  
  ORDER = (2..10).to_a + ['Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace']

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end

  def <=>(other_card)
    ORDER.index(rank) <=> ORDER.index(other_card.rank)
  end

  def ==(other_card)
    (rank == other_card.rank) && (suit == other_card.suit)
  end

  def to_s
    "#{rank} of #{suit}"
  end

end
```

### 9. Deck of Cards

Using the Card class from the previous exercise, create a Deck class that contains all of the standard 52 playing cards. Use the following code to start your work:

```ruby
class Deck
  RANKS = (2..10).to_a + %w(Jack Queen King Ace).freeze
  SUITS = %w(Hearts Clubs Diamonds Spades).freeze
end
```

The Deck class should provide a #draw method to draw one card at random. If the deck runs out of cards, the deck should reset itself by generating a new set of 52 cards.

Examples:

```ruby
deck = Deck.new
drawn = []
52.times { drawn << deck.draw }
drawn.count { |card| card.rank == 5 } == 4
drawn.count { |card| card.suit == 'Hearts' } == 13

drawn2 = []
52.times { drawn2 << deck.draw }
drawn != drawn2 # Almost always.
```

#### Solution:

```ruby
class Deck
  attr_reader :current_deck

  RANKS = (2..10).to_a + %w(Jack Queen King Ace).freeze
  SUITS = %w(Hearts Clubs Diamonds Spades).freeze

  def initialize
    make_deck
  end

  def draw
    make_deck if current_deck.empty?
    current_deck.delete(current_deck.sample)
  end

  private

  def make_deck
    @current_deck = []

    SUITS.each do |suit|
      RANKS.each do |rank|
        @current_deck.push(Card.new(rank, suit))
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### 10. Poker!

In the previous two exercises, you developed a Card class and a Deck class. You are now going to use those classes to create and evaluate poker hands. Create a class, PokerHand, that takes 5 cards from a Deck of Cards and evaluates those cards as a Poker hand.

You should build your class using the following code skeleton:

```ruby
# Include Card and Deck classes from the last two exercises.

class PokerHand
  def initialize(deck)
  end

  def print
