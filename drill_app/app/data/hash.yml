- Create a new empty hash with a default value not set to `nil`.
- 1) Return the value of a specified key.  2) Return the values of multiple specified keys.
- Return the key for a given value.
- Add a key/value pair.
- Print out all keys.
- Print out all values.
- Print out all key/value pairs.
- Print out all key/value pairs where value meets certain conditions.
- 1) Return the max / min key / value.  2) Return the max / min n pairs, keys or values.
- Return new hash of pairs meeting certain criteria.
- Delete all key / value pairs where value meets certain conditions.
- 1) Combine two hashes into a new one.  2) Combine two hashes by mutating the caller.
- Change the value stored under a given key.
- From an array of strings, create a hash of all elements meeting a given description (e.g., contain `is`, or are longer than 6 chars).  Make the indices the keys and the elements the values.
- Manually iterate though a hash and print each value or key.
- Iterate through a hash's values and print each key.
- Return a key / value pair (if any) that is associated with a given key.  Do so first by returning an array, then by returning a single-pair hash.
- Return a key / value pair (if any) that is associated with a given value.  Do so first by returning an array, then by returning a single-pair hash.
- 1) For a given block, do any, all, or no pairs match?  2) Write a method that takes blocks, returns a boolean in response to the previous questions.
- Delete the key / value pair at a given key.
- 1) Return true / false if a given key is present.  2) Return true / false if a given value is present.
