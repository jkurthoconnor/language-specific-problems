      Our program is about slowly building up proficiency in fundamentals, while at the same time exposing you to new workflows and practices. This requires a long, deliberate, and sometimes circular path to learning. Don't rush, take it slow, follow the path, and you'll be transformed. This is the slow path to mastery.
